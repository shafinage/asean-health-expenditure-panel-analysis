## Choice of Panel ARDL Framework
The core empirical framework is the **Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL)** model.

Panel ARDL was chosen because:
- the variables exhibit **mixed orders of integration** (I(0) and I(1)),
- the time dimension is sufficiently long to analyze dynamic relationships,
- both **short-run adjustments** and **long-run equilibria** are of interest.

Unlike static panel models, panel ARDL explicitly models adjustment dynamics following economic or policy changes.

## Estimation Strategy: PMG
The study employs the **Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator**.

PMG is appropriate when:
- long-run relationships are assumed to be **common across countries**,
- short-run dynamics are allowed to differ by country.

This assumption aligns well with ASEAN contexts, where countries share structural similarities in health systems but differ in institutional capacity, income levels, and policy timing.


## Long-Run Relationship and Cointegration
Before estimation, the analysis tests for **panel cointegration**, which indicates whether health expenditures, economic growth, and health outcomes move together in the long run.

Establishing cointegration is essential because:
- it confirms the existence of a stable long-term relationship,
- it prevents spurious regression results,
- it justifies the use of an error-correction specification within the ARDL framework.


## Short-Run Dynamics and Error Correction
The panel ARDL model incorporates an **error correction mechanism**, which captures how quickly deviations from long-run equilibrium are corrected over time.

The error correction term:
- reflects the speed of adjustment after a short-run shock,
- provides insight into how responsive health outcomes are to changes in expenditure and growth.

A statistically significant correction term indicates convergence toward long-run equilibrium.


## Causality Analysis
To complement the ARDL results, the study conducts **panel causality testing**.

This step helps distinguish:
- whether health expenditures influence health outcomes,
- whether health improvements influence economic growth,
- whether bidirectional relationships exist.

Causality analysis strengthens the policy interpretation by clarifying the **direction of influence**, not just correlation.


## Interpretation Approach
Results are interpreted with emphasis on:
- economic and policy relevance rather than statistical significance alone,
- differences between short-run and long-run effects,
- heterogeneity across health outcome indicators.

This approach ensures that findings are meaningful for real-world health financing decisions rather than purely technical conclusions.


## Summary
Overall, the methodological framework combines:
- dynamic panel modeling,
- long-run equilibrium analysis,
- short-run adjustment dynamics,
- causality assessment.
