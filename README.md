# Empirical Panel Analysis  
## Health Expenditures, Economic Growth, and Health Outcomes in ASEAN Countries

This repository presents a **portfolio summary of an empirical health economics study** examining the long-run and short-run impacts of health expenditures and economic growth on health outcomes across ASEAN countries.  

The project applies **panel econometric techniques** to cross-country data and is presented here in **redacted and summarized form** for research portfolio purposes.

---

## Research Background
Health outcomes in ASEAN countries vary significantly despite sustained economic growth and rising healthcare spending. Understanding how different forms of health expenditure and macroeconomic conditions influence population health is essential for **evidence-based health financing and policy decisions**, particularly in developing and middle-income economies.

---

## Research Question
How do health expenditures and economic growth affect health outcomes in ASEAN countries in the short run and long run?

---

## Study Objectives
- To evaluate the impact of health expenditures on health outcomes across ASEAN countries  
- To examine the role of economic growth in shaping population health  
- To distinguish between **short-run and long-run effects** using dynamic panel models  
- To provide policy-relevant insights for health financing strategies in ASEAN

## Data Overview
- **Countries:** ASEAN member states  
- **Data type:** Balanced panel data  
- **Sources:** World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)  
- **Health outcomes:**  
  - Life expectancy  
  - Infant mortality  
- **Key explanatory variables:**  
  - Health expenditure indicators  
  - Economic growth variables  
  - Control macroeconomic factors  

All raw datasets and institutional identifiers are excluded from this public repository.

## Methodological Approach
This study employs **panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL)** modeling to capture both short-run dynamics and long-run relationships.
These methods are suitable for heterogeneous panels and mixed integration orders, making them appropriate for cross-country ASEAN analysis.

A summarized version of study method can be found in [asean-health-expenditure-panel-analysis](summary-methodology.md)

## Key Findings (Summary)
- Health expenditures exhibit **statistically significant long-run effects** on health outcomes  
- Short-run impacts vary across countries and indicators  
- Economic growth contributes indirectly to health improvements but does not substitute targeted health spending  
- Evidence suggests asymmetric effects depending on expenditure type and outcome measured  

Detailed numerical outputs are intentionally redacted; summarized results are presented visually.

## Policy Implications
- Increasing health expenditure alone is insufficient without effective allocation  
- Long-term health improvements require **consistent and sustained investment**  
- Policymakers should differentiate between short-term fiscal responses and long-term health financing strategies  
- ASEAN countries may benefit from region-specific health expenditure frameworks
